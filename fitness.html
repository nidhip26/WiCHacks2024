				<h3>WOMEN</h3>
				<p> Cardiac disease, infeertility, migraine headaches, psychiatric disorders, and strokes are biologically different in women. 

				Obesity, arthritis, asthma and bronchitis, seizures, headcis, and more occur more frequently in women than in men.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="body-col">
				<h3>FACTS WE THINK YOU SHOULD KNOW...</h3>
				<p>Diseases such as sleep apnea or heart attacks in women can go undiagnosed because they don't have similar "textbook" symptoms compared to their male counterparts. The Physician's Health Study examined the effect of aspirin on cardiovascular disease involving 22,000 patients. Not a single one of them was female!</p>
			</div>
			<div class="body-col">
				<h3>PEOPLE OF COLOR</h3>
				<p> NAM repotyed that minorities are less likely than white persons to be given appropriate cardiac care, recieve kidney dialysis or transpants, and be given the best treatments for stoke, cancer, or AIDS.

				Research suggests that individuals with at least some medical training hold and may use false beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whites to inform medical judgements that may contibute to racial disparities in pain assessment and treatment</p>

					<h3>BUILD MUSCLE MASS</h3>
				<p>Men carry proportionally more mass — both fat and muscle — in their upper bodies, while we women tend to be more bottom-heavy. This means our center of mass is lower, this makes us more stable and controllable because our relative weight is closer to the ground.

				Take advantage of your lower center of mass and implement exercises such as skater jumps and agility drills to further hone your balance and flexibility, develop strength and power, and burn mega-calories. And while pull-ups and push-ups may be warm-up moves for men, you can use them for developing strength and muscle mass.</p>

					<h3>HOUR GLASS FIGURE</h3>
				<p>If your goal is to balance your physique aesthetically and make your lower body appear smaller without actually shrinking it, then think like a man and hone in on your upper half. From a body-sculpting standpoint, having wider lats and shoulders makes your waist look smaller and gives you an hourglass silhouette.</p>
				<!-- Building muscle comes easier for men, partly because of how they train but also because of their hormonal makeup: Men naturally have more testosterone than women, and therefore a greater propensity for developing muscle. But there is actually a “time of the month” when men and women are hormonally similar.The first two weeks of a woman’s cycle (days 1 to 14), however, are prime time for building muscleand fat loss.
				 Program your training around your cycle: Reserve HIIT and heavy training days for the first two weeks when your hormonal makeup is more “masculine,” and focus on isolation moves and recovery protocols during the second two weeks when female hormones run amok. -->

					<h3>BURN FAT</h3>
				<p>Women are great at burning fat during aerobic work, and estrogen is associated with a greater preference for fat oxidation. Because of this, our bodies learn to store fat to be used during long cardio sessions, as opposed to men who store excess calories as muscle glycogen — they burn more carbohydrates during training

				The solution here is to do less cardio but at a higher intensity. Research suggests that women may undergo higher cardiovascular and metabolic strain during high-intensity interval training workouts and recover better between intervals.

				<p>Transepidermal water loss(TEWL), which is a measurement that represents the amount of water that escapes from our skin and is used as a reflection of skin water barrier integrity. TEWL was found to be greater in Black skin compared with White skin. TEWL measurements of Asian skin were inconclusive.</p>

				<h3>HOW SKIN COLOR AFFECTS SKIN</h3>
				<p>Black people have a 2.5 times greater spontaneous desquamation rate (peeling skin) compared with Caucasians and Asians, possibly accounting for an increased frequency of dry skin seen clinically in Black people. Those with lighter skin types tend to suffer more skin damage due to UV exposure (photoaging), which means they are prone to showing signs of aging much more readily than those with darker skin. This photoaging leads to fine lines, wrinkles, dry and sagging skin due to loss of elasticity as well as hyperpigmentation.Those who have darker skin tones, like Type III and IV, will display signs of aging much later in life. They can, however, suffer issues like dark circles and discoloration.</p>

				<h3>SKIN SENSITIVITY IN POC</h3>
				<p>Darker skin tones are more sensitive to topical ingredients like alpha hydroxy acids and beta hydroxy acids than Caucasian skin. This can lead to an unwanted inflammatory response that can cause side effects like post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. </p>
